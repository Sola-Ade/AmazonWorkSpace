        <h2>My favourite animal:<br>Elephant🐘</h2>
        <p>Elephants are renowned for their remarkable intelligence, which is evident in their complex social structures, problem-solving abilities, and long-term memory. These majestic creatures exhibit behaviors such as empathy, self-awareness, and grief, reflecting deep emotional understanding. They use tools, recognize themselves in mirrors, and can follow human gestures, showcasing advanced cognitive abilities. Their large brains, particularly the highly developed hippocampus and cerebral cortex, support their sophisticated mental functions. Elephants' intelligence enables them to form strong social bonds and navigate diverse environments, making them one of the most intelligent species in the animal kingdom./p>
